Cupcake app
=================================

This app contains an order flow for cupcakes with options for quantity, flavor, and pickup date.
The order details get displayed on an order summary screen and can be shared to another app to
send the order.

In this codelab I learned to navigate a multi-screen app using the Jetpack Navigation component. Also defined routes, handled them in a NavHost, and used function type parameters to separate the navigation logic from individual screens as well as how to send data to another app using intents and customize the app bar in response to navigation. Last I added tetsting rules to test the navigation of the app.
